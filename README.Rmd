colSBM is an R package which implements methods for clustering and inferring the
mesoscale structure for collection of networks. In particular, it allows to:

* Find a common mesoscale structure in a collection of networks by
using a Stochastic Block Model (SBM) extension for the joint modeling of
collection of networks.

* Provide a clustering of the nodes of each networks.
Classifies networks in groups of networks with similar mesoscale structures.

Mathematical details of the methods as well as simulation studies and
applications can be find in @collection .

## Installation

You can install the development version of colSBM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Chabert-Liddell/colSBM")
