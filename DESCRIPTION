Description: Finds a common mesoscale structure in a collection of networks by 
    using a Stochastic Block Model (SBM) extension for the joint modeling of 
    collection of networks. Provides a clustering of the nodes of each networks.
    Classifies networks in groups of networks with similar mesoscale structures.
