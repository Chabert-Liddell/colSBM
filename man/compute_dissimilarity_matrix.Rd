\arguments{
\item{collection}{A bmpop or bisbmpop object on which to build the
dissimilarity matrix}

\item{weight}{The weighting to apply to the block proportions. One of "max"
or "mean", defaults to "max".}

\item{norm}{The norm to use, either one of "L1" or "L2". Defaults to "L2".}
}
\value{

between the networks.
