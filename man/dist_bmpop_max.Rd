\title{Compute the dissimilarity between 2 mesoscale structures}
\usage{
dist_bmpop_max(
  pi,
  alpha,
  delta = c(1, 1),
  weight = "max",
  norm = "L2",
  directed
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pi}{A list of two probability vectors}

\item{alpha}{A list of two connectivity matrices}

\item{delta}{A vector of 2 density parameters (optional)}

\item{weight}{One of "max" (default) or "mean". See details}

\item{norm}{"L1"or "L2" norm for the computation}

\item{directed}{Are the structure of the networks directed?}
}
\value{
The dissimilarity between two mesoscale structure.
}
\description{
Compute the dissimilarity between 2 mesoscale structures
}
\details{
If weight is "max" then the weight of each block is computed as
\code{pmax(pi[[1]], pi[[2]])}. If "mean", then we take the average. "max"
penalize to a greater extent the difference in block proportion between
structure.
}
\examples{
pi <- list(c(0.5,0.5), c(0.1,0.9))
alpha <- list(matrix(c(0.9,0.1,
                       0.1, 0.05), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2),
               matrix(c(0.9,0.1,
                       0.1, 0.05), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2))
dist_bmpop_max(pi, alpha)
