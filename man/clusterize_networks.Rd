\arguments{
\item{netlist}{A list of matrices.}

\item{colsbm_model}{Which colSBM to use, one of "iid", "pi", "delta",
"deltapi".}

\item{net_id}{A vector of string, the name of the networks.}

\item{directed}{A boolean, are the networks directed or not.}

\item{model}{A string, the emission distribution, either "bernoulli"
(the default) or "poisson"}

\item{fit_sbm}{A list of model using the \code{sbm} package. Use to speed up
the initialization.}

\item{nb_run}{An integer, the number of run the algorithm do.}

\item{global_opts}{Global options for the outer algorithm and the output}

\item{fit_opts}{Fit options for the VEM algorithm}

\item{fit_init}{Do not use!
Optional fit init from where initializing the algorithm.}

\item{full_inference}{The default "FALSE", the algorithm stop once splitting
groups of networks does not improve the BICL criterion. If "TRUE", then
continue to split groups until a trivial classification of one network per
group.}
}
\value{
A list of models for the partition of a collection of networks
