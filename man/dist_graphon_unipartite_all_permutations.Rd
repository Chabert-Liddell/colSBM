\title{Graphon distance for bipartite SBM over all permutations of the blocks}
\usage{
dist_graphon_unipartite_all_permutations(pis, alphas)
}
\arguments{
\item{pis}{A list of two probability vectors (row)}

\item{alphas}{A list of two connectivity matrices}
}
\value{
The graphon distance between two mesoscale structure.
}
\description{
Graphon distance for bipartite SBM over all permutations of the blocks
}
\details{
The graphon distance is computed as the L2 norm between the
graphons of the two structures. This function takes into account the
possible permutation of the blocks and returns the minimum distance.
