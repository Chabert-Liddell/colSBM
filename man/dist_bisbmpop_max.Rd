\title{Compute the dissimilarity between 2 mesoscale structures}
\usage{
dist_bisbmpop_max(pi, rho, alpha, delta = c(1, 1), weight = "max", norm = "L2")
}
\arguments{
\item{pi}{A list of two probability vectors (row)}

\item{rho}{A list of two probability vectors (columns)}

\item{alpha}{A list of two connectivity matrices}

\item{delta}{A vector of 2 density parameters (optional)}

\item{weight}{One of "max" (default) or "mean". See details}

\item{norm}{"L1"or "L2" norm for the computation}
}
\value{
The dissimilarity between two mesoscale structure.
}
\description{
Compute the dissimilarity between 2 mesoscale structures
}
\details{
If weight is "max" then the weight of each block is computed as
\code{pmax(pi[[1]], pi[[2]])}. If "mean", then we take the average. "max"
penalize to a greater extent the difference in block proportion between
structure.
